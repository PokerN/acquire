# Acquire

## Object of the game

Have the most money at the end of the game. You make money by forming corporations, buying
the right stock at the right time, as well as merging and expanding corporations in which you own stock.

## Components

* A 12 x 9 grid gameboard
* 108 tiles, one for each gameboard cell

## Gameplay terms:

**CORPORATION:**
Two or more connected tiles (not diagonally) identified by a corporation building

**UNINCORPORATED TILE:**
One or more tiles that have not yet been incorporated

**ACTIVE CORPORATION:**
A corporation that is on the gameboard

**SAFE CORPORATION:**
A corporation that has 11 or more tiles on the gameboard

**CORPORATION FOUNDER:**
The player who creates a corporation by joining two or more tiles

**FOUNDER'S BONUS STOCK:**
The founder of a corporation is given one free stock card
of that corporation

**MAJORITY AND MINORITY STOCKHOLDERS:**
The players who own the most and second-most stock cards
of a corporation

**MAJORITY AND MINORITY STOOKHOLDERS' BONUSES:**
The amounts are shown on the information card. The bonus value
depends upon the name of the corporation and the number of tiles
in the corporation. The majority and minority stockholders receive
these bonuses from the bank at the end of the game, and also if
their corporation goes "defunct" during the game.

**MERGER:**
When two or more corporations are joined together via a played tile

**MERGEMAKER:**
The player who places a tile that connects two or more corporations

## Game setup

Each player starts with $6,000.

**Determine who goes first:** Each player draws a tile from the facedown
cluster and puts it faceup on the matching letter/number space on
the gameboard. The player who plays a tile closest to 1A goes first.
(9A is closer than 1B.) Leave the tiles on the gameboard.

*Note:* If two or more of these tiles are adjacent, they are considered
unincorporated tiles. If an additional tile is added later, then they
become a corporation.

All players draw six tiles and stand them up so that the other players
can’t see them.

**Show or hide assets:** Players must now decide as a group whether
the money and stocks they acquire will be openly displayed. An open
display is strongly recommended for new or inexperienced players.
If money and stock are not displayed, the game is even more challenging
because players must try to remember how much stock each
player has purchased.

*Note:* At any time during the game, a player may ask how many
stocks of a company are still unpurchased.

## How to play

Each player does the following three things in order:

1. Play a tile onto the gameboard by putting it on its matching
space. (For example, the 1A tile goes on space 1A.)

2. Buy stocks of any active corporations. There is a limit
of three total per turn.

3. Draw a new tile from the facedown cluster.

See the following for a complete explanation of each step:

### 1. Playing a tile

Depending upon where a tile is played, it may form a
corporation or it may merge two or more corporations.
(Of course, a tile may also be played which does nothing.)

**Founding a corporation:** When a player places a tile next to
an unincorporated tile already on the gameboard (vertically
or horizontally, not diagonally), a corporation is founded.
The corporation founder first selects an available corporation 
building marker from the stock market tray and places
it on any one of the corporation’s tiles. The player then
receives a free founder’s bonus stock (of that corporation)
from the tray.

*Note:* If players are already holding all the corporation’s
stock cards, then no founder’s bonus stock is given out.

Any tile that would form an eighth corporation cannot be
played. (There are only seven corporations in the game.)
However, such a tile might be played later in the game if a
merger makes a corporate building marker available again.

**Merging corporations:** When a player places a tile so that it
connects two (or more) corporations, a merger takes place.
The larger corporation (the one with more tiles) survives
and the smaller corporation becomes defunct. During the
merger, the merging tile does not add to the size of either
corporation for any purpose. If the corporations are the
same size, then the mergemaker decides which corporation
survives. The surviving corporation absorbs the defunct
one. The corporation building marker of the defunct
company is removed from the gameboard and returned
to the tray.

*Note:* if more than two corporations are merged by one
tile, see multiple mergers section below for details.

**Safe corporations:** A corporation that contains 11 or more
tiles is considered “safe” and cannot be absorbed by another
corporation for the rest of the game. A safe corporation
can absorb a smaller corporation, but two safe corporations
cannot merge. Any tile that would merge two safe corporations 
is permanently unplayable and can be discarded
and replaced later in the turn.

**Majority and minority stockholders’ bonuses:** At the time
of a merger, all players must reveal the exact number of
stocks in the defunct company that they own. The players
with the most and second-most stocks are declared majority
and minority stockholders. The banker pays them the majority
and minority stockholders’ bonuses as described below.

If only one player owns stock in the defunct corporation,
that player gets both bonuses. If there is a tie for majority
stockholder, add the majority and minority bonuses
together, divide evenly and round up to the next payable
dollar amount if necessary. (The minority shareholder
gets no bonus.) If there is a tie for minority stockholder,
split the minority bonus among the tied players. Round
resulting bonuses up to the nearest $100 if necessary.

To determine the bonus amount, find the defunct corporation’s 
name on any information card. Then look down
the card to the number of tiles in the defunct corporation.
Then look across the card to the majority and minority
bonus amounts. This bonus money comes from the bank.

*Note:* Stockholders in the surviving corporation don’t get
any bonuses, but the value of their stock will probably go
up because the corporation has grown larger.

After bonuses have been paid out, each stockholder must
decide what to do with the defunct stock. Each player, starting
with the mergemaker and continuing clockwise, can hold, sell,
and trade the defunct stock cards.

* **Hold:** Stock may be held in expectation of starting another
corporation with that name later.

* **Sell:** Stock may be sold back to the stock market at a price
determined by the number of tiles in the defunct corporation
before the merger.

* **Trade:** Stock may be traded. For every two defunct stock
cards traded in, the player gets one stock in the surviving
corporation. Of course, the supply of surviving stock cards
is limited, so you can’t acquire stock that is not available.

*Note:* Players are allowed to choose more than one of the
above options. For example, a player could hold onto a few
of the defunct stocks, sell some and trade some.

**Multiple mergers:** It is possible that one tile could cause
the merger of three or four corporations. The largest
corporation survives and the smaller ones become defunct.
The mergemaker breaks any ties. The smaller corporations
are dealt with - one at a time - from largest to smallest.
Majority and minority stockholder bonuses are paid out as
described previously, and then the defunct stock is held,
sold or traded. As usual, the mergemaker goes first.

### 2. Buying stocks

After placing a tile, the player may buy stock in any active
corporation. This is optional. A player may decide to buy
none or up to three stock cards on a turn. For example,
a player can buy one stock card in three different active
corporations - or one in one corporation and two in another
- or three stock cards in one corporation.

**Price per share:** This is determined by first finding the name
of the corporation on any information card, looking down
the card to the number of tiles in the corporation and then
looking across the card to the stock price. Money is paid
into the stock market tray. Remember, there are only 25
stocks for each corporation, so when all 25 are sold, no more
can be purchased.

**Running out of money:** Aggressively competing to become
the majority stockholder in a corporation can be risky.
Invest wisely in corporations that are small and close to
bigger ones. A player who runs out of money cannot buy
stock. A player with no money still places a tile on each of
his/her turns, if possible, but must wait for a corporation in
which he/she owns stock to go defunct in order to get money.
Remember, a player can sell a corporation’s stock only
after the corporation has gone defunct, and at the end of
the game. No loans are allowed from other players or the
stock market bank.

### 3. Drawing a tile

A player takes a tile from the facedown cluster to replace
the one he/she played. This is not done until the end of
the turn. At this time, if a player has any permanently
unplayable tiles (ones that merge two safe corporations),
that player puts the unplayable tiles to the side (faceup)
and draws an equal number of replacement tiles. This can
only be done once per turn. If more unplayable tiles are
drawn, the player must wait until his/her next turn to
discard them. Tiles that would form an eighth corporation
cannot be traded in.

## Ending the game

The game ends when one player, during his/her turn, announces
that either all active corporations are safe or that one corporation
has 41 or more tiles on the gameboard. A player does not have
to announce that the game is over if it is to his/her advantage
to continue playing. After announcing that the game is over,
the player may finish the turn.

Majority and minority shareholders’ bonuses are paid out
for all active corporations, and all stocks are sold back to the
stock market bank at current prices (as shown on the information
cards). Stock in a corporation that is not on the board is worthless.
The player with the most money wins!
